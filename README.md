PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) is a hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It occurs when the ovaries produce multiple immature eggs that develop into cysts, leading to irregular periods, hormonal imbalance, weight gain, acne, excessive hair growth, and fertility issues. This project aims to provide awareness, resources, and possible management approaches through lifestyle changes, medication, and technology-driven solutions.
